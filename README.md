# My First Xeneta

I did not changed in the setup too much to show you I can even be comfortable with any environment.

I used vue + some packages



## Usage

```sh
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Single build
$ npm run build
# Watcher build (Rebuilds on file changes)
$ npm run watch
# Start development server at localhost:3000
$ npm start
```

# Task
Create a simple port-to-port search page, with visualization of the freight rates over time, on a provided port-port
combination, within a customizable date range.

* Make it pretty-ish, using your awesome CSS skills (Animate CSS3 Lib + vue-chartjs + bootstrap for layout without JS + My pure CSS3 collapsible + Shadows )
* Make it efficient, limit network use, and load fast (Vue + Webpack + Babel + axios + ._debounce )
* Feel free to add your personal flair (Vue2-Daterange-picker, supporting ejs with Vue JS on same view)



# Missing
I should include those, but as you know I am working full time, I worked on this task just 10 ~ 15 minutes every day
I believe if I work on it full time I can do better:

* Advanced setup for webpack
* Splitting code into consts.js , store.js , main.js 
* More validation rules
* Adding more functions for cheapest, expensive ones. 
* Using Promises
* Importing css to local, some libs its on CDN.
* Importing fonts into backend of NodeJS i.e download opensans package 



Please read the full document for the details on the build process and the APIs.
